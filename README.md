# CSharpHTMLUI
This project creates a base for designing forms within a C# application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The main reason for that is that HTML gives you endless possibilities to design a UI. Which means that forms are completely customizable. That is something that the default forms can´t provide. If you really want to change the look of your application, you need to override the methods and properties of the forms. That isn´t the easiest and most performant way of creating a UI.

# Goal
The Goal is to be able to create complete form applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript which can be deployed onto other devices.
